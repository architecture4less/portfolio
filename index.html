      <p class="column top">
        My name is Jared. I'm an undergraduate student at Florida Gulf Coast University, studying to become a software engineer. I take great interest in Machine Learning, and I'm planning for a career where I can build new tools to solve complex problems. My dream job is to utilize my passions for the scientific research of diseases and cures.
      </p>
      <p class="column top">
        In my free time, I like to follow video-game programming tutorials off of the internet, try my hand at creating algorithms for various mathematical problems I run into, and design expansive plugins for sandbox games such as Minecraft. I am always eager for opportunities to improve my thinking process when I tackle these projects.
      </p>
      <p class="column top">
        Sometimes, I also like to draw or build cities, sci-fi ships, and space colonies  in sandbox games. I have a lot of experience working with other people from around the world on building projects and plugin design projects related to these games. I absolutely love collaborating with others, while working individually.

        Here are some of the projects I've done for my classes:
      </p>
      <ul class="divided">
        <li>
          <div class="wider">
            <h4>Intro to Computer Science: Scratch Project</h4>
            <p>
              You can find it <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/281821605/" />here</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              A simple dungeon-explorer game made on scratch.mit.edu for my Intro to Computer Science class. It features randomly generated floors (with stairs and treasure chests), as well as a simple battle system for when you encounter enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project gave me the chance to work in a limited programming environment and devise clever solutions to bring my idea to life.
