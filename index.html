    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="column-group">
      <p class="column">
        My name is Jared. I'm an undergraduate student at Florida Gulf Coast University, studying to become a software engineer. I take great interest in Machine Learning, and I'm planning for a career where I can build new tools to solve complex problems. My dream job is to utilize my passions for the scientific research of diseases.
      </p>
      <p class="column">
        In my free time, I like to follow video-game programming tutorials off of the internet, create my own algorithms for various mathematical problems I run into, and design expansive plugins for games such as Minecraft. I am eager for opportunities to improve my thinking process when I tackle these projects, as I'm hopeful this skill may transfer into my future career.
      </p>
      <p class="column">
        Sometimes, I also like to draw or build cities, sci-fi ships, or space colonies  in sandbox games. I have a lot of experience working with other people from around the world on building projects and plugin design projects related to these games. I absolutely love collaborating with others while working individually.
